## PRs

### What is a PR (Pull Request)?

A pull request is a way to submit changes you make to the main project repository.  
It allows anyone to make a fork of the repo, make changes, and request that those commits are pulled to the master branch.

### Why do we use PRs?

We use PRs because they allow people to contribute without creating huge amount of clutter in the main repo. This is because all the clutter stays in the forks, and only the commits we actually want are merged to master.

### How do I submit a PR?

You can submit a PR on the GitHub website. Instructions can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

### PR Standards

Create a new branch and PR for each addition/feature/etc.  
This allows us to accept/reject PRs on a feature-by-feature basis without having a reject a feature only because it is in the same PR as something we do not want.  
The name of your PR should be short and descriptive.

- Fork
	- Your own local copy of the repo, where you have full control
	- You can submit a PR for a branch in your fork into the master branch of the base repo
